Hi there!

My name is Yiran Zhou, or you can call me kblack.

I've spent three years on my bachelor of Computer Science at ECNU (East China Normal University).

My GitHub homepage is <a href="https://github.com/kblackcn" target="_blank">kblackcn</a>, and you can also find some of my works at my <a href="https://git.i64d.com" target="_blank">private git</a>.

Actually, I started learning to code when I was 10, and it has really been an adventurous decade.

In the beginning, it's just about competitive programming, and I use Pascal. Then I realize it's an interesting thing to do, so I started learning more languages and more knowledge about computers. And now, here I am.

In the past few months, I worked as an intern at Bytedance. My job is to refactor and maintain an important service in the ad pipeline.

Now I'm at Tencent, as an intern again. This time my job is more about distributed storage system.
